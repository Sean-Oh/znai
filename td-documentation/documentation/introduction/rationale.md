# Stale Documentation

Keeping documentation up-to-date is a hard task. 
The further documentation is from the code the more likely it won't be updated when a feature is added or changed.

# Part Of Workflow

As part of your code review you check that there are:
* no design violations
* no subtle bugs
* updated auto tests

Now you can also add to it
* documentation is updated
 
# Keep in sync 

Our code base already contains a wast amount of data:
* examples (test or dedicated examples dir)
* config files
* tests 

Doing copy&paste between sources takes time and quickly becomes out of sync process. 
Instead you will refer existing artifacts and documentation will be updated automatically when underlying artifact changes.
