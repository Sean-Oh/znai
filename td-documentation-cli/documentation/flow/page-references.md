# Follow the Order

Most of the documentation should have a natural order to follow. 
Links to navigate to a next page are at the end of each page.

Crate links to remind an *essential* concept introduce previously. There is a chance that a person skipped over it or forgot. 

Avoid: links that navigate users forward. It breaks the flow of a documentation. 

# Links

To create an `external` link use 

```markdown
[Link Title](http://external/reference)
```
    
To refer `internal` page within your documentation use 

```markdown
[internal link](dir-name/file-name#optional-page-section-id)
```

Note: you can get `page-section-id` by selecting that section using `TOC` and checking the browser `url`.
