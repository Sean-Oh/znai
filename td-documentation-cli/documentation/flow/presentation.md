# Equal Flow

When people build presentations for a product, they focus on a proper flow: to make sure that people
who never used the product are not lost.
But if you go to the documentation site, quite often the flow is not newbie friendly anymore.

`MDoc` can turn any page into a presentation at will *(zoom in icon next to each page title)*.
If you write your documentation with presentation mode in mind it should greatly improve the flow of your documentation.

Look at the table of the content on the left under `Introduction`.
That order was changed after I presented `MDoc` a few times to make it flow better. As a result it made it more natural to read.
