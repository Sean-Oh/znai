# Operation definition

If you have a file with [Open API](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/README.md)
definition (aka swagger file) you can render a definition by given `operationId`

    :include-open-api: open-api/pet-store.json {operationId: "addPet"}
    
:include-open-api: open-api/pet-store.json {operationId: "addPet"}

Note: descriptions are treated as markdown, using [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/help/) specification

# Auto Section

Use `autoSection` property to automatically generate page section with a title taken from an operation summary.

    :include-open-api: open-api/pet-store.json {operationId: "findPets", autoSection: true}
    
Note: Section below is automatically generated by `include-open-api` 
    
:include-open-api: open-api/pet-store.json {operationId: "findPets", autoSection: true}

# Tags

Specify `tags` to automatically generate multiple entries from a service definition file.

Let's consider [Uber API definition](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/examples/v2.0/json/uber.json) example.

    :include-open-api: open-api/uber.json {tags: "Estimates", autoSection: true}

Note: Sections below are automatically generated by `include-open-api` 

:include-open-api: open-api/uber.json {tags: "Estimates", autoSection: true}
