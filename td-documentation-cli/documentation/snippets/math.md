# LATEX

To render math you can use [latex](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) math expressions. 
Surround latex expression with fenced block and specify `latex` as a language

    ```latex
    \forall x \in X, \quad \exists y \leq \epsilon
    ```

The result will be a following math expression.

```latex
\forall x \in X, \quad \exists y \leq \epsilon
```

Rendered expression also participates in presentation mode by automatically scaling up
